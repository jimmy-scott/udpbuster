udpbuster - report udp traffic to detect udp floods
===================================================

I was just messing around with libpcap (see pcapfun on github).

This tool is based upon pcapfun, but the idea was to report the total
amount of udp packets and bytes from comming from each source address.

This code compiles and is tested on OSX, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
Small note for FreeBSD/OpenBSD: you still need to use GNU make.

You must provide a device (to capture the packets on) and a pcap filter.
If you know don't know how a pcap filter looks like, check the manpage
of tcpdump or pcap-filter, it's the same type of filter that you provide
to tcpdump or wireshark/tshark, but as a single argument instead. It is
a good idea to specify at least "ip and udp" as the filter, to avoid
that every packet has to travel to userland and through this program.

    ./udpbuster eth0 "ip and udp and port 666"

It will open the device, set the filter on the device, checks the link
type, then capture and handle the packets that match the filter, and
after 10 seconds it will abort the loop and report the traffic.

By default it will only track up to 100 source addresses, but you can
edit the source and increase the table size. Note that it's a linear
search to insert something in that table, so make sure your hardware
can handle it for the amount of source addresses you want to track..

Experiment with the source if you want it to do something else!
